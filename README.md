### Statement

For this project, we wanted to make something that relates to us personally by making a game.  The project is intented for learning new thing such as creating a game that we both really like because we both have been playing video game as young as we can remember. We hope to learn how we can apply the topics we learned in class into something that we can create for later uses and gain experience using with GitHub for a team project.

### Analysis

2htdp/image: Will be use for displaying Images/Sprites
2htdp/universe: Will be use for communication between the user and program
Rsound: Assist with sounds proccessing 

- Will you use data abstraction? 
We will be using a list containing objects to calucate the sprite postion and check for collusion.
- Will you use recursion? 
We plan on using recursion to get the random number to generate branches for collusion and as well as input from the player's such as the arrow keys. 
- Will you use map/filter/reduce? How? 
We plan on using map for dealing with list.

Collision check for sprites and branch at the same side. The tree is a list of left right and none while sprites can only position left and right. If they are at the same side and the same time, game over.

### External Technologies

- process sound 
We will be using Rsound to add audio effect/effects unit and a music along when responsing to the user input.
- retrieve information 
We might also plan on creating a high score list that stores the user scores into a databse and display it back to the user.

### Data Sets or other Source Materials

N/A

### Deliverable and Demonstration

For demonstration day, we are planning to have a complete game that is very similar to the orginal game. At the live demo people will be able to test out our game and as well as sounds, music, and highscore will be able to be display in the final demonstration. 

### Evaluation of Results

If we can complete the movement control, add music/sounds, get the highscore system working, and the collusion function to work then we have successful finish our goals for the project.
